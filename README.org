* regswap.el

`regswap.el` swaps two regions of text within a buffer. This can be useful for various text editing tasks where you need to quickly interchange the contents of two regions.

** Features

- Swap two regions of text within a buffer.
- Supports interactive functions for easy region marking and swapping.
- Provides visual feedback with customizable highlighting for swap regions.
- Handles edge cases such as empty regions and overlapping regions gracefully.
- Includes convenient keybindings for quick access to its functionality.

** Installation

To install `regswap.el`, you can download it from the following URL:

[[http://github.com/skitov/regswap][http://github.com/skitov/regswap]]

After downloading, add the following to your Emacs init script:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/regswap")
(require 'regswap)
(regswap-setup-default-keybindings)
#+END_SRC

** Usage

The package provides two interactive functions:

*** `regswap-mark-region`

If no swap region is defined, `regswap-mark-region` sets the current region as the swap region. If a swap region is already defined, this function swaps the contents of the current region with the swap region and then undefines the swap region.

- *Keybinding:* `C-c C-c w`

*** `regswap-cancel`

This function undefines the swap region and removes any highlighting overlay.

- *Keybinding:* `C-c C-c C-w`

*** Highlighting

When `regswap-highlight` is non-nil, the swap region is highlighted with `regswap-reg-face` when non-empty. If the swap region is empty, its position is indicated by displaying a `â•‘` character, highlighted with `regswap-empty-face`. By default, `regswap-highlight` is set to `t`.

** Edge Cases

- *Empty Regions:* Either the current region or the swap region can be empty. In such cases, the content of the non-empty region is moved to the position of the empty region.
- *Intersecting Regions:* If the current region and the swap region overlap, no changes are made to the buffer.

** Buffer Changes

If changes are made to the buffer when a swap region is defined:

- If the changed area overlaps with the swap region, swapping is cancelled.
- If changes are inside the swap region, the swap region adjusts accordingly, and the modified text will be swapped.
- If changes are made before the swap region, the swap region shifts by the length difference of the changed text.
- Insertions at the borders of the swap region are treated as outside of the swap region.

** Keybindings

To set up the suggested keybindings, include the following in your Emacs init script:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(regswap-setup-default-keybindings)
#+END_SRC

This binds `C-c C-c w` to `regswap-mark-region` and `C-c C-c C-w` to `regswap-cancel`.
